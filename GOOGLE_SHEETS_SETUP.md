## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access denied" Error**
- Check your API key is correct
- Ensure the sheet is publicly accessible or shared with service account
- Verify the Google Sheets API is enabled

**"Sheet not found" Error**
- Verify the Google Sheets URL is correct
- Make sure the sheet exists and isn't deleted
- Check if you have permission to access the sheet

**"No valid team members found" Error**
- Ensure you have a "Name" column with actual names
- Check that data starts from the correct row
- Verify the range specification includes your data

**"Invalid Google Sheets URL" Error**
- Use the full URL from your browser address bar
- Format should be: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SHEET_ID]/...`

### Data Import Issues

**Missing Skills/Interests**
- Use comma-separated values: "JavaScript, React, CSS"
- Avoid special characters or extra spaces
- Check spelling and formatting

**Incorrect Capacity Values**
- Use decimal numbers between 0.0 and 1.0
- Examples: 1.0 (full-time), 0.5 (half-time), 0.2 (20% capacity)

**Duplicate Team Members**
- By default, duplicates (same name) are skipped
- Use "Replace existing" option to overwrite all data
